<h2> 
	Working with XML data from HMDB 
</h2>

<p>
	This repository will have some code that illustrates how to deal with XML data downloaded from the HMDB website 
	(<a href="http://www.hmdb.ca/downloads">http://www.hmdb.ca/downloads</a>)
</p>
<p>
	The buildHMDB_df shows how to extract various values from HMDB to create a data frame that contains information about 
	a metabolite name as well as various IDs (HMDB, KEGG, METLIN, PubChem), the chemical formula, its monoisotopic mass
	and the predicted logP values.
